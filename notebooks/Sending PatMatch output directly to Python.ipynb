Plus, you'll get the file for script to convert it to dataframe and import its the main function. We don't need to run PatMatch yet because we will be addressing that part of the workflow in this notebook. \n",

    "This option has the distinction that all the steps in it can be combined in one cell of the notebook. This is because the `!<command>` approach makes a temporary shell outside of the notebook environment to which it sends the command after the exclamation site. After that command is processed and any communication handled, that subshell where it ran is discarded. Given the transient nature of this environment you'll find `!cd` never seems to work as they discuss [here](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html), search `!cd` to find the pertinent section where they also show you the line magics solution.
