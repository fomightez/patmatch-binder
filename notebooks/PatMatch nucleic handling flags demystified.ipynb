    "***TL;DR:***\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<font color=\"red\">If you want the pattern search to be performed on both strands of the supplied sequence, as is the default of the web-based PatMatch tools, you actually want to use the `-c` flag when authoring the command.</font>**\n",

    "If that is sufficient for your uses, feel fee to skip this notebook and continue on matching patterns with PatMatch. If you want to know more...\n",

    "The notebook contents below illustrate clearly, step-by-step why I suggest this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The situation\n",
    "\n",
    "I found the two choices for flags for PatMatch covered in PatMatch [USAGE](PatMatch%20initial%20demo%20and%20introduction.ipynb#Usage) a little unclear given typically options of web-based PatMatch list three choices. For example the associated option for [PatMatch for the Arabidopsis genome](http://www.arabidopsis.org/cgi-bin/patmatch/nph-patmatch.pl) looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">If DNA, Strand:\n",
    "- both strands\n",
    "- Watson(given)\n",
    "- Crick(reverse complement)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The listing for that option at the site for [PatMatch with the S. cerevisiae genome](https://www.yeastgenome.org/nph-patmatch) looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If DNA, Strand:\n",
    "- Both strands\n",
    "- Strand in dataset\n",
    "- Reverse complement of strand in dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet [the USAGE](PatMatch%20initial%20demo%20and%20introduction.ipynb#Usage) for the stand-alone, command line based PatMatch simply lists:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Run PatMatch with the command:  \n",
    "perl patmatch.pl [residue] [pattern] [sequence file] [number of mismatches] [mismatch types]\n",
    "Residue types:  \n",
    "-n for nucleotide  \n",
    "-c for complementary strand  \n",
    "-p for protein  \n",
    "\n",
    "Showing only two options for nucleic. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Three options in the web-based offerings but only two in the command line program?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the situation, I initially I thought maybe one was for one strand and the other for the other strand and I could list both in the command. Or perhaps, I was expected to run first with `-n` and then with `-c` and combine the results. However, a few tests show that neither of those are the case.\n",

And we also have shown here that converting to the reverse complement is easily done within Python as well, and so those options are are available from the command line, too. It's just not as obvious how to that here as with the web-based implementations.)\n",
