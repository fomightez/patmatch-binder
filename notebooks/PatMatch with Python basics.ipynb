Moreover, that path takes you away from Python to where you have have less power. To use Python with it you'd still have to read it back in and the way I saved it made reading it back in immensely easier. Similarly, to have saved it as an Excel it would have added another dependency to my script which limits where it can easily be run. Often it is best to keep things simple.

Because this is being run in an ephemeral remote instance, you'll want to download any realy data you generate ASAP. **Bear in mind, if you are inactive for more than 8 minutes the instance can be culled. Treat this computing resource as temporary and highly unstable.**\n",

Because this particular notebook was run in the `notebooks` directory, you have to select that folder and navigate into it first before you'll see the files you made with the steps above. Some of the text files made can even be viewed in that file viewing directory. However, you'll have to download the Excel file to see if it worked as there is no rendering/viewing built in. This interface can also be used to upload your own data if it is not available on the web or you simply prefer a GUI interface over using shell or Python commands to retrieve data.\n",

Because of the way we did things the way we did in this notebook, it would easy enough to run from scratch to bring it back into memory. You can imagine though as you do real analysis things will change over time and you may like to go back to an older result to see what changed or use a simpler form for developing downstream steps. Or, of course, it can just be a **convenient way to not have to go back to square one when you want to return to an analysis after working on something else**.\n",
